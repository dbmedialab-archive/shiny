# Shiny

Ev'rythings shiny, cap'n, not to fret!

Shiny is a collection of dumb React components. Check out the [storybook](https://dbmedialab.github.com/shiny/)!

In Aller Media, we use shiny as part of a four-layered frontend system:
  1. **[shiny](https://github.com/dbmedialab/shiny) (dumb frontend components): Makes stuff look good**
  1. wolverine (smart web app): Translates from what something *is* to what it should *look like*; handles state; renders pages
  1. wolverine-api (smart API layer): Decides what we should display to the user; composes pages
  1. wolverine-fetcher (dumb API layer): Fetches data from backend systems

## Relation to Firefly (the TV series)

The name is very inspired!
